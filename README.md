## **Why Did I Create OROMIQ?**

I created OROMIQ because I was tired of **surface-level strategies** that lack identity and purpose.  
As someone carrying **Aramean roots**, I realized our heritage—the first language, the spark of civilization—deserves to live in the modern world, not as nostalgia but as **a foundation for innovation**.

**OROMIQ was born out of rebellion:**  
- Rebellion against shallow marketing.  
- Rebellion against brands losing their **authenticity** in the noise of trends.  

I wanted a platform where **strategy meets philosophy**, where **brands can think, feel, and speak with intelligence and heritage**.
